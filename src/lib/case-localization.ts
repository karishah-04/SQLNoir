// SERVER-ONLY case localization.
//
// This module dynamically imports the per-locale case narratives
// (messages/cases/<locale>/<id>.json) AND overlays the server-only real
// solutions for paid cases (src/cases/solutions.server.ts). Both of those must
// stay out of the client bundle, so this file must NOT be imported from any
// "use client" component or any module reachable from one. It is deliberately
// kept separate from case-utils (which IS client-reachable via local-progress /
// CasesExplorer) so webpack never pulls the json import-context or the paid
// answers into a client chunk. See C4 in PRELAUNCH-REVIEW.md.

// the map, so they keep the solution that ships in their own case file.
//
// Overlay by PRESENCE in the map, NOT by isCaseFree(): when monetization is off
// (the open-source / self-host default) isCaseFree() is true for every case, and
// short-circuiting on it here would leave paid cases with their empty
// placeholder solution -> permanently unsolvable on a fresh clone. This module is
// server-only, so always overlaying is safe; with monetization ON the /cases list
// and the detail page still strip paid solutions before they reach the client.
