        execute your query in the order you write it. You write SELECT first,

        exactly why WHERE cannot use aggregate functions and HAVING can.

        runs at step 4, after GROUP BY has already created groups. That is why
        HAVING can use COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG(). Those values exist by then.

        Mistake 1: Using aggregate functions in WHERE
      </h3>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This is the most common error. WHERE runs before GROUP BY, so aggregates
        like COUNT() do not exist yet.

        This one does not throw an error. It just runs slower than it should.

        Mistake 3: Forgetting GROUP BY with HAVING
      </h3>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-green-400 p-4 rounded text-sm overflow-x-auto">
          {`-- ⚠️ This is valid but rarely useful
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM suspects
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;`}
        </pre>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2">
          Without GROUP BY, the entire table is treated as one group. This
          checks if the total suspect count exceeds 10. It works, but it is
          almost never what you want. Add GROUP BY to make HAVING useful.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">
        Mistake 4: Column aliases in HAVING (dialect trap)
      </h3>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-green-400 p-4 rounded text-sm overflow-x-auto">
          {`-- Works in MySQL and SQLite:
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM suspects
GROUP BY city
HAVING total > 3;

-- Fails in PostgreSQL and SQL Server:
-- ERROR: column "total" does not exist
-- Use the full expression instead:
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;`}
        </pre>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2">
          MySQL and SQLite let you reference SELECT aliases in HAVING.
          PostgreSQL and SQL Server require the full aggregate expression. For
          portable SQL, always use the full expression.
        </p>
      </div>

      <DetectiveTip variant="warning" title="The Performance Trap">
        Using HAVING to filter individual column values (like{" "}
        <code>HAVING city = &apos;Miami&apos;</code>) technically works in most
        databases. But it forces SQL to group ALL rows first, then discard
        groups. WHERE eliminates rows before grouping, which is significantly
        faster on large datasets. When in doubt, prefer WHERE.

        &ldquo;average,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sum,&rdquo; you probably want WHERE.

            Can I use WHERE and HAVING in the same query?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Yes, and you should when the situation calls for it. WHERE filters
            rows before grouping, HAVING filters groups after. Using both is the
            most efficient pattern: WHERE reduces the dataset early, then HAVING
            applies aggregate conditions to smaller groups.

            What happens if I use HAVING without GROUP BY?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Most databases treat the entire result set as one group. So{" "}
            <code>HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 10</code> without GROUP BY checks if the
            total row count exceeds 10. It works but is rarely useful. You
            almost always want GROUP BY with HAVING.

          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Because WHERE runs before GROUP BY in SQL&apos;s execution order.
            Aggregates like COUNT() and SUM() only exist after grouping. WHERE
            has not seen the groups yet. Use HAVING for aggregate conditions.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">
            Is HAVING slower than WHERE?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Generally yes. HAVING processes data after grouping, which requires
            scanning more rows. WHERE eliminates rows early, reducing the
            workload for GROUP BY and HAVING. If you can express a filter with
            WHERE instead of HAVING, WHERE will be faster.

          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            It depends on your database. MySQL and SQLite allow it (e.g.,{" "}
            <code>HAVING total_count &gt; 5</code>). PostgreSQL and SQL Server
            require the full expression (e.g.,{" "}
            <code>HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 5</code>). For portability, use the full
            aggregate expression.
