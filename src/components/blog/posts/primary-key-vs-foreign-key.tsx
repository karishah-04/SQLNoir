        If you&apos;ve ever stared at a database and wondered why some columns
        are marked as keys while others aren&apos;t, you&apos;re not alone.
        Primary keys and foreign keys are the backbone of relational databases,
        but most explanations make them sound more complicated than they need to
        be. Let&apos;s fix that.

        What is a Primary Key?
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A primary key is a column (or combination of columns) that uniquely
        identifies each row in a table. Think of it like a suspect ID in a
        criminal database: no two suspects share the same ID, and every suspect
        must have one.

        <strong>Four rules of primary keys:</strong>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          <strong>Unique:</strong> No duplicates allowed
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not null:</strong> Every row must have a value
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Immutable:</strong> Should rarely change (changing IDs causes
          chaos)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Indexed:</strong> Automatically indexed for fast lookups

        Mistake 1: Forgetting the Foreign Key Constraint
      </h3>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Just because a column is named <code>customer_id</code> doesn&apos;t
        make it a foreign key. You need to explicitly define the constraint:

        Mistake 2: Using Business Data as Primary Key

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Using email addresses, phone numbers, or social security numbers as
        primary keys seems convenient but causes problems when that data

        Mistake 3: Not Indexing Foreign Key Columns
      </h3>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Primary keys are automatically indexed, but foreign keys are not. This
        means JOINs on foreign keys can be slow on large tables:

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">

        </pre>
        <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2">
          Index foreign key columns for faster JOINs and constraint checking.

      <DetectiveTip variant="tip" title="Pro Tip">
        Most database tools show you which columns are indexed. Check your
        foreign keys. If they&apos;re not indexed and you JOIN on them
        frequently, add indexes.

            Can a foreign key also be a primary key?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Yes! In junction tables for many-to-many relationships, the
            composite primary key often consists of two foreign keys. Example: a{" "}
            <code>case_suspects</code> table with{" "}
            <code>(case_id, suspect_id)</code> as the composite primary key,
            where both columns are also foreign keys.

            Can a table have multiple primary keys?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            No. A table can have only ONE primary key. However, that primary key
            can be a COMPOSITE key made of multiple columns. You might hear
            &ldquo;multiple primary keys&rdquo; but this is incorrect
            terminology.

            What is a composite key?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            A composite key is a primary key made of two or more columns. All
            columns together must be unique. Common in junction tables:{" "}
            <code>PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)</code>.

          <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">
            Do foreign keys hurt database performance?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Foreign keys add overhead on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE because the
            database must check referential integrity. However, this overhead is
            usually small and the data integrity benefits outweigh the cost.
            Index your foreign key columns to minimize the impact.

            Is a foreign key required?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            No. Foreign keys are optional but strongly recommended. Without
            them, the database allows orphaned records (evidence linked to
            non-existent cases). You CAN skip them, but your data quality will
            suffer.

        The WHY is simple: primary keys let you find specific rows instantly,
        and foreign keys let you connect related data without duplicating it.
        Without keys, you&apos;d either have massive duplication or no way to
        link your data together.
