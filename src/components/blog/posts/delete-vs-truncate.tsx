      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        DELETE is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command. It works with
        transactions, fires triggers on each deleted row, and logs every
        deletion to the transaction log. Think of it as carefully removing
        specific evidence from a case file while keeping a record of what you
        took.

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">

        TRUNCATE is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command. It doesn&apos;t
        delete rows one by one. Instead, it deallocates the data pages that hold
        your table&apos;s data. Think of it as burning the entire evidence room

        TRUNCATE is like burning the evidence room. In most databases (MySQL,
        PostgreSQL with auto-commit, SQL Server with auto-commit), once you
        TRUNCATE, the data is gone. Only within explicit transactions in
        PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle can TRUNCATE be rolled back.

        DML vs DDL: Why It Matters
      </h3>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        DELETE is DML because it manipulates data. TRUNCATE is DDL because it
        restructures the table (deallocates pages). This classification affects
        permissions, transaction behavior, and how replication tools handle each

        If other tables reference your table via foreign keys, TRUNCATE will

        Performance: When TRUNCATE Really Matters

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The performance difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE becomes dramatic
        as table size grows.

      </p>

      <ul className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>DELETE is O(n)</strong> - Time scales linearly with row count.
          10 million rows means 10 million row-level operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>TRUNCATE is O(1)</strong> - Constant time. It deallocates
          pages regardless of how many rows exist.

      <DetectiveTip variant="tip" title="When DELETE Is Fine">
        For small tables (under 100,000 rows), the difference is usually
        negligible. Use DELETE if you need the safety features, and don&apos;t
        prematurely optimize.

          </h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-0">
            TRUNCATE is faster, especially on large tables. DELETE processes
            row-by-row while TRUNCATE deallocates data pages in bulk. For tables
            with millions of rows, TRUNCATE can be 100x faster.

          </h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-0">
            It depends on your database. PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle
            allow rollback within explicit transactions. MySQL does not. Always
            test in your specific environment.

          </h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-0">
            No. Unlike DELETE, TRUNCATE does not execute any triggers defined on
            the table. If you have audit triggers or cascade logic, use DELETE
            instead.

        The Bottom Line
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Use DELETE</strong> when you need precision (WHERE clause),
        safety (rollback), or triggers to fire. It&apos;s the careful, surgical
        approach.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Use TRUNCATE</strong> when you&apos;re clearing all rows from a
        table and speed matters more than recoverability. Perfect for staging
        tables, test resets, and bulk operations.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Both commands have their place. Knowing when to use each is the mark of
        a developer who understands SQL at more than just syntax level.
